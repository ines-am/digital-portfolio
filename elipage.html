<h3>2023 - Hot Coco Break </h3>
   <img src="eli.jpeg" width="500">
  <h3 class="elic">Allthough it wasn't winter when we got hot coco it still helped us feel better about regents and gave us time to chat and catch up on summer plans. The main suject, my friend Eli, didn't know it at the time but he would move to a different school far from Forest Hills, and would be missed by loads of people.  As a friend who missed his presence going home I decided to do a portrait of him during one of our last encounters. </h3> <h3 class="elic" > At the cafe me, Eli, and another friend of ours sat at we all decided to order hot coco and a pastery. I don't like coffee very much but hot coco still makes me feel apart of a group drinking coffee. A sweet, smooth, hot drink that still serves its purpose. </h3>
