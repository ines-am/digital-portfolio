<h3>2023 - Hot Coco Break </h3>
   <img src="eli.jpeg" width="500">
  <h3 class="elic">Allthough it wasn't winter when we got hot coco it still helped us catch up on summer plans. The main suject, my friend Eli, didn't know it at the time but he would move to a different school far from Forest Hills. Missing his presence while going home I decided to do a portrait of him during one of our last encounters. </h3> <h3 class="elic" >I don't like coffee very much but hot coco still makes me feel apart the a group drinking coffee. A sweet, smooth, hot drink that I love. </h3>
