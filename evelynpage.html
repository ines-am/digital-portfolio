     <h3 class="evelync">Going home with freinds always makes the ride feel safer, and on a hot day back to school an over priced pepsi float helps us cool down.</h3> <h3 class="evelync" > As a kid when I would go to the park I always got a sweet treat from the Mr.Frosty truck that would pull up to its iconic jingle. </h3> 
     <h3 class="evelync" > This is an <i>oil painting</i> that commemorates the end of my day going home with friends.</h3>
